# Learning `pug`

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Tutorial: <https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-pug>

```bash
yarn add pug
yarn global add pug-cli
```

```bash
pug -w . -o ./html -P
# -w means watch
# -o is for output
# -P is for prettify
```

`test.pug` -> `html/test.html`
